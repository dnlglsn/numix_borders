# Numix Thick Borders
The default window borders on Numix are too thin. I like them thicc. Copy the `xpm` files into `/usr/share/themes/Numix/xfwm4`, reload your Numix theme, and enjoy being able to actually resize windows with your cursor again.

**Caution**: Copying the files will override the default borders. So, if you care about those thin things, back them up.
